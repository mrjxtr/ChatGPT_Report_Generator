# ChatGPT Survey Leads Report Generator

To create a digital product like the one you're envisioning, where ChatGPT helps generate a report based on survey responses, you can follow these steps. I'll break down each component and the associated costs.

## **1. Landing Page**

**What to Do:**

- **Design and Development:** Create a simple landing page with an opt-in form where users can enter their email addresses and other basic information.
- **Tools:** You can use tools like Wix, WordPress, or Leadpages for easy setup and customization.
- **Cost:** Minimal to moderate, depending on whether you use a free or paid service for hosting and design. If you hire a designer or use premium templates, costs can range from $50 to $500.

## **2. Survey Form**

**What to Do:**

- **Create Survey:** Set up a survey form using Google Forms, Typeform, or another form builder tool.
- **Integration:** Ensure the survey responses are collected in a format that can be used for generating reports.
- **Cost:** Generally free or low-cost depending on the form builder. Typeform has a free plan, but advanced features may require payment (around $30/month).

## **3. ChatGPT Integration for Report Generation**

**What to Do:**

- **API Access:** Use the OpenAI API to connect to ChatGPT. Youâ€™ll need to set up API access to send survey responses to ChatGPT and receive generated content.
- **Report Generation:** Write a script or use a backend service that takes survey responses, formats them into a prompt, sends them to ChatGPT, and generates a report.
- **Automation:** Integrate this with your survey form. You might need a backend service (like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions) to handle this automation.
- **Cost:** OpenAI's API usage is billed based on the number of tokens processed. Prices are variable, but it typically costs around $0.02 to $0.12 per 1,000 tokens depending on the model. Backend services may also have costs associated with usage.

## **4. Final Page with Results**

**What to Do:**

- **Display Results:** Create a page that shows the generated report to the user. This can be a simple HTML page or an integrated part of your landing page.
- **Cost:** The cost is included in the landing page or web hosting costs.

## **5. Email Notifications**

**What to Do:**

- **Send Emails:** Automate the process of sending the report to users via email. Use an email service provider like Mailchimp, SendGrid, or Amazon SES.
- **Cost:** Costs vary based on the provider. For example, Mailchimp offers a free plan for up to 500 subscribers, while paid plans start around $10/month.

## **How It All Works Together:**

1. **User visits the Landing Page:** They enter their email and other details to start the survey.
2. **User fills out the Survey Form:** Survey responses are submitted.
3. **Survey Responses are Sent to ChatGPT:**
   - Your backend service collects the survey responses.
   - It sends the responses to the OpenAI API, which uses ChatGPT to generate a report.
4. **ChatGPT Generates the Report:**
   - The backend service formats the data, sends it to ChatGPT, and receives the report.
5. **User is Redirected to the Final Page:**
   - The final page displays the generated report.
   - An email is automatically sent to the user with the report attached and a link to book a call.
6. **Follow-up:** The user receives the report via email and has the option to book a call.

## **Summary of Costs:**

1. **Landing Page:** $50 - $500 (depending on design and hosting)
2. **Survey Form:** Free to $30/month (for advanced features)
3. **ChatGPT API Usage:** Variable, depending on usage. Approx. $0.02 - $0.12 per 1,000 tokens.
4. **Backend Service:** Minimal cost for basic functions, more if scaling up.
5. **Email Notifications:** Free to $10/month (depending on provider and number of emails)

By following this plan, you can create an MVP for generating leads through a survey funnel integrated with ChatGPT. Let me know if you need further details or help with any specific part of the process!
