# ChatGPT Report Generator (PROJECT PLANNING AND OVERVIEW)

## Project Summary

The goal of this project is to create a digital product powered by ChatGPT to generate comprehensive reports based on input data. Users will provide data, and ChatGPT will process it to produce insights and recommendations. The final report will be displayed to the user and saved in a preferred format (e.g., PDF, Word, or HTML). The entire process will be automated, ensuring a seamless flow from data input to report generation and storage.

> Hereâ€™s a Python-based outline for the simplified process of creating a report using ChatGPT, using CSV and PNG files as input:

### **1. Data Input (PNG and CSV)**

Use Python to load and preprocess the data from CSV and PNG files before sending it to ChatGPT.

#### **Example Script for Reading CSV and PNG:**

```python
import pandas as pd
from PIL import Image

# Load CSV data
csv_data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Load PNG image
image = Image.open('data.png')

# Process or display if needed
print(csv_data.head())  # Preview CSV data
image.show()  # Preview image
```

### **2. ChatGPT Integration for Report Generation**

Use the OpenAI API to send the processed CSV and PNG data to ChatGPT, where it will generate a report.

#### **Example Script for Report Generation:**

```python
import openai
import os

# Load OpenAI API key
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
openai.api_key = api_key

def generate_report(csv_data, image_description):
    prompt = f"Generate a report based on this CSV data: \n{csv_data.to_string()}\n\nImage description: {image_description}"
    
    # Call OpenAI API
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=1500,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    
    # Get the response text
    report = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return report

# Example usage
image_description = "This is a placeholder for the image content."
report = generate_report(csv_data, image_description)
print(report)
```

### **3. Display and Save Reports**

You can either display the report in the console or save it as a file (PDF, text, etc.).

#### **Example Script to Save Report:**

```python
# Save the report as a text file
with open('generated_report.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write(report)

print("Report saved as 'generated_report.txt'")
```

### **How It Works:**

1. **Data Input:** The CSV and PNG files are read and preprocessed.
2. **ChatGPT Integration:** The CSV data and image description are sent to ChatGPT via the API to generate a report.
3. **Display/Save Report:** The generated report is displayed or saved locally as a text file.

This setup allows you to handle input data, generate reports, and save them, all using Python scripts. Just ensure you have API access for ChatGPT via the OpenAI platform.
